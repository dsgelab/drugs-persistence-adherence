*Genetic and environmental determinants of drug purchasing behaviour*

By leveraging nation-wide registry data and genetic data from Finngen, we aim to model and identify common behavioural patterns in medications purchasing. Pharmacological treatments efficacy is highly influenced by continuous and regular use, particularly in the case of long-lasting prevention therapies. The identification of the genetics underlying different medication-taking behaviours and the association with other behavioural, demographic and socioeconomic factors will help in pointing out which categories of patients are at higher risk of discontinuation and poor adherence to treatments.
